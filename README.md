# angularContacts
POC that shows how to integrate AngularJS and REST services using Spring.It also shows how to use Spring JPA for interacting with the database.

Spring-Boot generates a single standalone .jar that "magically" (Spring rocks!) sets up the entire application (angular content, services, application server, etc)..

### How to run

```sh
$ mvn clean package
```
```sh
$ java -jar target/(filename).jar
```
Browse to http://localhost:8080

### Version
1.0.0
